# Superstore Analysis

This project attempts to analyze sales data for a superstore, identifying the highest performing regions, segments, and item categories. The project spots Furniture as a serious area of improvement when it comes to net profits, and from there goes into deeper analysis looking into the different components to further isolate those based on their performance. So far, the project finds that Tables and Bookcases are the two most sub-categories that need to be addressed for improvement, especially in the consumer market.

We take a deeper look into Furniture, but before we do that, we take note of the main categories composition and realize that Furniture currently makes only 6.4% of total profit:

### Takeout from Above

Of Furniture, Chairs and Furnishings are fairing far better. Bookcases and Tables would need to be further analyzed and later addressed with solutions.
